In Color Settings, the user can tap on the squares representing the background color and the pattern color, and adjust the RGB sliders to change the colors. As the user moves the sliders, the color of the selected square updates in real-time. The values of the RGB sliders are saved throughout the duration of the app so that the user can tweak the chosen color.
